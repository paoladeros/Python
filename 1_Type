'type' is how Python represents different types of data

int stays for integers
declaration: type(11)

float stays for real numbers with decimal places
declaration: type(11.123)

str stays for string
declaration: "Hello, world"

You can change the type of the expression. This is called 'typecasting'

int --> float
float (2): 2.0

int (1.1):1 (in this case, you are losing some information about the data)

str(1): "1"
str(1.5): "1.5"
