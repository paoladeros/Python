Branching
Branching allows us to run different statements for different inputs. 
If the statement is True, the program will run some predefined tasks, if the statement is False the program will ignore the task

That condition is expressed by 'if' function

age = 22
if age > 21

print ("You can vote")

The program will run this code because the condition is True.

If the condition is False, the program can run a 'else' function.

The 'elif' statement, short for else if, allows us to check additional conditions if the condition statements before it are False.
If the condition for the elif statement is True, the alternate expressions will be run
