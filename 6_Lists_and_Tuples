Lists and Tuples are compound data types
They are data structure in Python

Tuples 

Tuples are ordered sequence written as comma-separated elements within paranthesis
They can contain different types of data (int, float, str) but the type of the variable is tuple

tuple = ('hello', 1, 2.5)

You can access to an element by index
Index can be positive or negative

Positive index

tuple [0] = 'hello'
tuple [1] = 1
tuple [2] = 2.5

Negative index

tuple [-1] = 2.5
tuple [-2] = 1
tuple [-3] = 'hello'

Tuples can be concatenated by adding them

tuple2 = tuple + ('world', 4.5)
tuple2 = ('hello', 1, 2.5, 'world', 4.5)


len 
command to obtain the length of a tuple


Tuples are immutable, we can't change them
If we would like to manipulate a tuple we must create a new tuple instead


sorted 
function to sort tuples

The input is the original tuple, the output is a new sorted list

Rating (10, 9, 5, 2, 6, 8, 5
RatingSorted = sorted (Rating)
RatingSorted = (2, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10)


A tuple can contain other tuples. It is called nesting.


Lists

Lists are data structure in Python
Lists are an ordered sequence represented with square brackets
They can contain strings, floats, integers. We can nest other lists. We also nest tuples and other data structures. 
The same indexing conventions apply for nesting Like tuples, each element of a list can be accessed via an index
We can concatenate or combine lists by adding them


extend

L = ["apple", 10.1, 2021]
L.extend (["banana", 10])
L = ["apple", 10.1, 2021, "banana", 10]


append

L = ["apple", 10.1, 2021]
L.append (["banana", 10])
L = ["apple", 10.1, 2021, ["banana", 10]]


in which
"apple" represents L[0]
10.1 represents L[1]
2021 represents L[2]
["banana", 10] represent L[3]

One key difference is they are mutable

A = ["apple", 10.1, 2021]
A [0] = "mango"
A = ["mango", 10.1, 2021]


del

removes an argument from the list

A = ["apple", 10.1, 2021]
del (A [0])

A  : 10.1, 2021]


split

converts a string 
split converts every group of characters separated by a space into an element of a list

"banana milkshake".split ( )

["banana", "milkshake"]

We can use the split function to separate strings on a specific character known, as a delimiter

"A, B, C, D".split (",")

["A", "B", "C", "D"]


Multiple names referring to the same object is known as aliasing
Aliasing produces a side effect because When we set one variable B equal to A, both A and B are referencing the same list

B [0] = "hard rock"
A [0] = "banana"

A = B

--> B [0] = "banana"

You can clone list A, using

B = A  [:]

A = ["hard rock", 10, 1.2]
B = ["hard rock", 10, 1.2]

B refers to a new copy or clone
Now, if you change A, B will not change

A [0] = "banana"
B [0] = "hard rock"
