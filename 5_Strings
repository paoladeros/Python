A string is a sequence of characters contained within two quotes

my_variable: "Hello, world!"

Characters are positional, and are calculated in a vector starting from 0

my_variable[0]    

'H'


my_variable[12]

'!'

my_variable[14]  
Warning: it's out of line!

It will produce a log error:
string index out of range

'len' is the command to know the exact number of characters that make up the string

len(my_variable)    

13


Strings are immutable. You can't change them, but you can simply create a new one
