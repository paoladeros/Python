A string is a sequence of characters contained within two quotes

my_variable: "Hello, world!"

Characters are positional, and are calculated in a vector starting from 0

my_variable[0]    

'H'


my_variable[12]

'!'

my_variable[14]  
Warning: it's out of line!

It will produce a log error:
string index out of range

'len' is the command to know the exact number of characters that make up the string

len(my_variable)    

13


Strings are immutable. You can't change them, but you can simply create a new one

METHODS TO STRINGS

\n

It generates a new line

"Hello, world!\nThis is my first code"

Hello, world!
This is my first code


\t

It represents a tab

"Hello, world!\tThis is my first code"

Hello, world!  This is my first code



\\ 

It places a backslash

"Hello, world! \\ This is my first code"

Hello, world! \ This is my first code

Alternatevely, you can put a 'r' before the string:

print(r "Hello, world! \ This is my first code")

Hello, world! \ This is my first code


upper

a = Hello, world!
a.upper ( )
HELLO, WORLD!


replace

a = "Hello, world!"
a.replace ("world", "readers")
Hello, readers!


find

a = "Hello, world!"
a.find ('e')
1

If the output is not in the string, the value of 'find' will be negative

a = "Hello, world!"
a.find ('9')
-1
