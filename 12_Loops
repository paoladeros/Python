Loops

In Python, repeated executions are performed by loops
To better understand loops, we start with the definiion of 'range'.

Range

It is helpful to think of the range object as an ordered list

range(3)

It corresponds to a list of range(0, 3) which contains the elements: [0, 1, 2]


'For' and 'While' loops

'for' and 'while' are two commands in Python to perform loops.
for executes a statement a set number of time, 
while only runs if a condition is met. The code block will keep being executed until the given logical condition returns a False boolean value.
