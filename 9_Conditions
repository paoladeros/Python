Conditions in Python

Comparison Operators
Comparison operations compare some value or operand and, based on a condition, they produce a Boolean.
When comparing two values you can use these operators:

equal: ==
not equal: !=
greater than: >
less than: <
greater than or equal to: >=
less than or equal to: <=

a = 5
a == 6

It will procuce a False answer

We can apply the same methods on strings.

"apple" == "banana"

False


"apple" != "banana"

True
